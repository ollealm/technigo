  <p>With an EU-law requiring all sites to inform visitors about cookies most people have at least a basic understanding how 
  they are used to track site activity, and the most important usage is probably to know whether a user is logged in or not. 
  A bigger <b>privacy concern</b> is tracking cookies, especially from third-party, that can be used to compile long-term records of 
  individuals browsing histories.</p>
  <p>The term cookie was coined by computer programmer Lou Montulli when working on Mosaic <b>Netscape in 1994</b>. 
  His idea was to use a funktion from Unix called ”magic cookie” to store information in the browser checking 
  whether visitors to the Netscape website had already visited the site.</p>
  <p>Lou Montulli is also the creator of the infamous <b>&lt;blink&gt;Tag&lt;/blink&gt;</b>, an integral part of the early 
  internet, but now mostly unsupported. It was made as an easter-egg and he has later stated it was the worst thing that he did 
  for the internet.<p>
